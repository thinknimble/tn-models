# @thinknimble/tn-models

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- Migrate from Zod 3 to Zod 4.

  **Breaking:** the peer dependency is now `zod@^4.0.0`. Consumers must upgrade to Zod 4. No public API changes beyond the peer requirement — see `MIGRATION.md` for the upgrade path.

  - Update peer dependency to `zod@^4.0.0`
  - Type guards (`isZod*`) discriminate on Zod 4's `schema.type` strings instead of `_def.typeName` / `ZodFirstPartyTypeKind`
  - Recursive snake/camel conversion updated for Zod 4 internals (catchall-based passthrough detection, raw `defaultValue`, transparent branding)
  - TypeScript types move from `z.ZodTypeAny` to `z.ZodType` / `z.core.SomeType`
  - Inferred shape types preserve optional (`?`) keys and enum primitives

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f61869a: `createApi` now accepts any axios-like HTTP client via a structural `AxiosLike` contract, not only a concrete `AxiosInstance`. Existing axios consumers are unaffected (an `AxiosInstance` still satisfies `AxiosLike`); fetch-style wrappers and other clients with their own config/response types are now assignable as well. The `StringTrailingSlash` URL brand is retained to guard against Django `APPEND_SLASH` redirects.

## 4.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 36dbb7a: Correct the import examples in the README. Two of them told readers to import from `@thinknimble/tn-models-fp`, which is deprecated on npm and frozen at 2.14.0. The README ships in the package, so the npm page showed those examples too.

## 4.1.2

### Patch Changes

- bbb4ed0: Point `repository` and `homepage` at the tn-models repository. Both still named the old tn-models-fp repository, so the links on the npm page sent readers to the previous name.

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 62e6ff9: Fix issue with custom calls returning readonly fields which would cause unnecessary type issues on end users of the library.
- 403194d: Swap strip with unwrap
- 9c894a9: Remove readonly from custom call outputs

## 4.0.1-canary.1

### Patch Changes

- 403194d: Swap strip with unwrap

## 4.0.1-canary.0

### Patch Changes

- Remove readonly from custom call outputs

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 03d0b2f: # Breaking changes

  Remove `readonly` library util in favor of native `z.ZodReadonly`.

  Upgrades should remove the library `readonly` since it is not going to be handled anymore.

  ## Reasoning

  Zod recently released a native way of handling readonly. Although this readonly is not exactly the same as what we call "readonly" from our db resources. It does allow us to mark fields as readonly and we can take advantage of this mark and make the corresponding type inferences to treat these fields as our own readonly.

  ## Migration guide
  - Upgrade Zod to >=3.23.8
  - Remove any `import {readonly} from '@thinknimble/tn-models'`
  - Replace any `readonly(zod)` with `zod.readonly()` which is the native way of doing this with zod
  - That should be it!

## 3.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 187e807: Fix issue on `createCustomServiceCall` where outputShapes with nested ZodBranded fields would cause the types for the resulting service call function to break.

## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 35fb8f8: Add boolean to accepted types for filters

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 986108e: - Allow disabling warning logs with `disableLoggingWarning` option
  - Try-catch all `parse` calls so that users don't just get the intelligible zod error in console.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2f61919: ## Migration Guide v2 - v3

  ### What's new?
  - Now all functions accept a single object as parameter. No more secondary parameters.
  - Improvements on the type layer ( non perceptible from user perspective). Removed all overloads for functions which were a pain to maintain. Now a single function definition makes the inference for all possibilities.

  ### How to migrate from v2

  For a full fledged example on how to migrate you can check the test file changes on the [v3 PR](https://github.com/thinknimble/tn-models-fp/pull/186).

  The summary is as follows:

  #### `createCustomServiceCall`
  - The callback no longer is in the second parameter. Instead we provide it in the first parameter as a `cb` field

  ```diff
  const testPost = createCustomServiceCall(
  {
    inputShape,
    outputShape,
  + cb: async ({ client, input, utils, slashEndingBaseUri }) => {
  +     const toApiInput = utils.toApi(input)
  +     const res = await client.post(slashEndingBaseUri, toApiInput)
  +     const parsed = utils.fromApi(res.data)
  +     return parsed
  +   },
  -async ({ client, input, utils, slashEndingBaseUri }) => {
  - const toApiInput = utils.toApi(input)
  - const res = await client.post(slashEndingBaseUri, toApiInput)
  - const parsed = utils.fromApi(res.data)
  - return parsed
  -}
  })
  ```

  #### createPaginatedServiceCall
  - options (`uri` and `httpMethod`) are no longer in the second parameter. Instead we pass them in an `opts` field in the first parameter.

  ```diff
  const paginatedServiceCall = createPaginatedServiceCall(
    {
      outputShape,
      inputShape,
  +   opts: {
  +      httpMethod: "post"
  +   }
    },
  -  { httpMethod: "post" }
  )
  ```

  #### `createApi`
  - If you don't have any custom calls in the `createApi` call then you should be good ✅
  - If you do have custom calls, move the second parameter into a `customCalls` field in the first parameter.

  ```diff
  const testApi = createApi(
    {
      baseUri,
      client: mockedAxios,
  +   customCalls: {
  +     testPost
  +   }
    },
  -  {
  -    testPost,
  -  }
  )
  ```

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- cdb5ea6: Make filters in built-in method `list` to be partial

## 2.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 0363678: - Fix paginated response returning brand in its type.
  - Fix wrong type error when trying to add models without entity or without an id field

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 482601b: Release tn-models from tn-models-fp.

  This is a major update and the api was completely changed in favor of a better type layer support for typescript users.

  Please read the docs at [our repo](https://github.com/thinknimble/tn-models-fp) for more information as to how can this new version be used.

## 2.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 71c1cc8: Prevent obfuscation of extra fields coming from responses. Now these fields will be available in the response (just won't be type-discoverable). Paginated calls will receive them as camelCased, whereas regular calls will receive them as they come from the raw response.

## 2.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 1aa2f85: Add chance to call built in methods without a trailing slash. TODO: type level remove restriction of axios

## 2.12.3

### Patch Changes

- 98b8519: Fix issue with `readonly` not properly working on Vue and other JS environments. Changed the way ZodBrand is being checked.

## 2.12.2

### Patch Changes

- 77705b2: Fix readonly fields not working properly on create model override. Now readonly fields should be completely ignored for create model override. Allowing you to re-use your entity models that have readonly fields in case you want to.

## 2.12.1

### Patch Changes

- b051a97: `createPaginatedServiceCall` fix not properly camel casing nested array fields

## 2.12.0

### Minor Changes

- a2c44a0: createPaginatedServiceCall allow url params to be passed to paginated call so that we can build our own uri with a function. Now if a `urlParams` is passed down to the inputShape we will take that as a uri parameter which will require to pass a function in second parameter

## 2.11.7

### Patch Changes

- 89f68e2: Fix `readonly` function being exported as type

## 2.11.6

### Patch Changes

- 5ebb3b2: createCustomServiceCall - allow output shape to be of type ZodArray

## 2.11.5

### Patch Changes

- bb2a6eb: custom calls - allow input and output shape to be native enums

## 2.11.4

### Patch Changes

- fd42759: Fix `GetInferredFromRaw` inferring readonly brands

## 2.11.3

### Patch Changes

- fcd3a2e: `createApi` show error when users try to pass things into `models` that are not valid

## 2.11.2

### Patch Changes

- ddad1f6: Fix `createApi` resulting type breaking if not passing any models to it

## 2.11.1

### Patch Changes

- a13361d: Fix `create` built-in method requiring readonly fields as input.

## 2.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 566582f: Make `create` method to always exist if there's a declared entity shape from `models`. This makes it so that if you want to use your own `create` shape in `models` you can, but that's now optional. If resolved from `entity` shape then the resulting callback signature is going to strip all readonly fields and `id` from the entity shape and use that resolved type as the input.

## 2.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 5dacdf6: Fix issue with return type of remove

## 2.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 8af767a: Allow ids to be of type string or number and infer them properly in the corresponding inputs from built-in methods. Improve branded types resolution of return types from built-in methods.

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- f976657: Add chance to declare readonly fields at root level of entity shapes. Introduce `update` and `delete` built-in methods for the api. `update` has a couple of variants which allow users to pick the right behaviour for their update calls

## 2.8.1

### Patch Changes

- b1392c9: Fix standAlone calls including base uri when it would always be undefined

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 33a6eb5: Add filters to the main methods of the library. `createCustomServiceCall` `createCustomServiceCall.standAlone` and `createPaginatedServiceCall` allow `filterShape` which yields a `parsedFilters` parameter in the callback for you to get snake cased parsed filters and pass them as parameters to your axios calls. Adding filters modify current input arguament so beware that you'll need an object with `input` and `filters?`

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- d17171e: Add `standAlone` function to `createCustomServiceCall`. This fn allows users to create a service call that does not need to be attached to any api, it can work on its own. The only extra requirement for this call is the axios client.

## 2.6.1

### Patch Changes

- ddecbf6: Fix paginated requests doing strict parse of responses instead of safe parse. Remove use of `parse` in `list` and `createPaginatedServiceCall`

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e64ed54: Allow passing filters to `createPaginatedServiceCall`. For this there's a new `models` field that can be used to pass the filters shape: `filtersShape`. You'll then get a `filters` optional key when using the service call which will allow you to pass the filters you declared

## 2.5.5

### Patch Changes

- 9679bd2: Fix missing argument in `Pagination.hasNextPage`

## 2.5.4

### Patch Changes

- b7f9346: Fix `createPaginatedServiceCall` erroring when not passing opts param. Now it should allow you to skip the second parameter and thus use its built-in defaults ( uri = '' , httpMethod = 'get' )

## 2.5.3

### Patch Changes

- dc5421e: Fix issue with nulls being considered of type object in js. Mischeck was crashing library on null values

## 2.5.2

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 25b3716: Fix issue where object fields of arrays were not properly cased

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 6f39fad: createCustomServiceCall: allow output shapes to be arrays. Improve createApiUtils so that output shpaes can also be arrays and manage them properly.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c97033: Add type-wrapper to axios client provided in `createCustomServiceCall` argument so that we make sure users pass a slash ending uri rather than any string. This has some caveats that have been updated in our README

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c6e3f47: Allow users to skip including models in their api creation. Models now is completely optional and types are properly inferred based on which models are passed. `create` model is not allowed to be passed alone, same for `extraFilters`.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- bc4193f: Change `endpoint` for `baseUri`. Update custom service calls baseUri parameter to have a better name and hint users they should consider that baseUri to contain a trailing slash

- 553cf31: Add createPaginatedServiceCall util to add better paginated requests

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes
